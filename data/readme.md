=================
Convention:
There are two tasks, files with "1" at the end are for the first task and with "2" are for the second task.
[test|train]_[tag|text]_[1|2].txt are files with data.
The best would be to use file answers.txt or (answers1.txt and answers2.txt) for files with answers generate by our programs

=================
Testing:
run ```perl evaluateN.pl filename```
where N is task number (1 or 2) and filename is your file with answers
